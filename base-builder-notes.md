# Base Builder Notes

This repository marks my first contribution as a builder in the Base ecosystem.  
I'm exploring how onchain development can empower open innovation and community-driven growth.

## Objectives
- Learn the fundamentals of building on Base.
- Experiment with smart contracts, open-source tools, and decentralized apps.
- Share progress and collaborate with other builders.

> “The future is onchain — and we're building it, one block at a time.”
